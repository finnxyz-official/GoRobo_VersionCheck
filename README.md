# 👋 Hi there.

Welcome to the **GoRobo VersionCheck** repository.

This repository only serves **one purpose**:
To verify whether a product (like Joinify) is running the correct and up-to-date version in Roblox games.

---

## 📌 Purpose

This repository contains a single plain text file:  
[`latest-version.txt`](./main/latest-version.txt)

This file is used by our systems to perform **remote version verification**.  
It helps us:
- Ensure license holders are using the latest version.
- Prevent unauthorized use of outdated or modified systems.
- Improve update handling and support.

---

## 🛑 What you will NOT find here

- ❌ Source code for any GoRobo products.
- ❌ APIs, tools, or libraries.
- ❌ Public documentation or installation guides.
- ❌ Any useful files unrelated to version control.

This repository is intentionally minimal. All core systems (Joinify, etc.) are closed-source and **license-protected**.

---

- Reverse engineering, redistribution, leaking, or bypassing are **strictly prohibited**.
